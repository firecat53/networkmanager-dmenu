- Connect to _existing_ WWAN and VPN connections

Requirements
------------

1. Python 2.7+ or 3.2+
2. NetworkManager
3. Dmenu. Basic support is included for Rofi_, but most Rofi configuration/theming should be done via Xresources.
4. Python gobject (PyGObject, python-gobject, etc.)
5. (Debian/Ubuntu based distros) libnm-util-dev and gir1.2-nm-1.0 (you have to
   explicitly install the latter on Debian Sid)
6. (optional) The network-manager-applet package (in order to launch the GUI connection editor, if desired. The nm-applet does _not_ need to be started.)
7. (optional) Pinentry. Make sure to set which flavor of pinentry command to use in the config file.
8. (optional) ModemManager for WWAN support.

Installation
------------

- Set your dmenu_command in config.ini if it's not 'dmenu' (for example dmenu_run or rofi). The alternate command should still respect the -l, -p and -i flags.
- To customize dmenu appearance, copy config.ini.example to ~/.config/networkmanager-dmenu/config.ini and edit.
- If using dmenu for passphrase entry (pinentry not set), dmenu options in the [dmenu_passphrase] section of config.ini will override those in [dmenu] so you can, for example, set the normal foreground and background colors to be the same to obscure the passphrase.
- Set default terminal (xterm, urxvtc, etc.) command in config.ini if desired.
- If using Rofi, you can try some of the command line options in config.ini or set them using the `dmenu_command` setting, but I haven't tested most of them so I'd suggest configuring via .Xresources where possible. 
- Copy script somewhere in $PATH
- If desired, copy the networkmanager_dmenu.desktop to /usr/share/applications or ~/.local/share/applications.
- If you want to run the script as $USER instead of ROOT, set `PolicyKit permissions`_. The script is usable for connecting to pre-existing connections without setting these, but you won't be able to enable/disable networking or add new connections.

OR

- Archlinux `AUR package`_

Usage
-----

- Run script or bind to keystroke combination
- If desired, dmenu or Rofi options can be passed on the command line instead of
  or in addition to the config file. These will override options in the config
  file.
