## Installation

- Copy script somewhere into $PATH OR

  - Archlinux: [AUR package][3] OR
  - Gentoo: [Woomy Overlay][4]
  - Nix: [Nix Packages][9]

## Requirements

1. Python 3.7+
2. NetworkManager
3. Dmenu (X), Rofi (X or XWayland), Wofi (Wayland) or Bemenu (X or Wayland)
4. Python gobject (PyGObject, python-gobject, etc.)
5. (Debian/Ubuntu based distros) libnm-util-dev and gir1.2-nm-1.0 (you have to
   explicitly install the latter on Debian Sid)
6. (optional) The network-manager-applet package (in order to launch the GUI
   connection editor, if desired. The nm-applet does _not_ need to be started.)
7. (optional) Pinentry. Make sure to set which flavor of pinentry command to use
   in the config file.
8. (optional) ModemManager for WWAN support.
9. (optional) notify-send for notifications (connected, disconnected, etc.)

## Configuration 

- To customize behavior, copy config.ini.example to
  ~/.config/networkmanager-dmenu/config.ini and edit.
- All theming is done through the respective menu programs. Set `dmenu_command`
  with the desired options, including things like `-i` for case insensitivity.
  See config.ini.example for examples.
- If using dmenu for passphrase entry (pinentry not set), dmenu options in the
  `[dmenu_passphrase]` section of config.ini will set the normal foreground and
  background colors to be the same to obscure the passphrase. The [Suckless
  password patch][6] `-P` option is supported if that patch is installed. Rofi,
  Wofi and Bemenu will use their respective flags for passphrase entry.
- Set default terminal (xterm, urxvtc, etc.) command in config.ini if desired.
- Saved connections can be listed if desired. Set `list_saved = True` under
  `[dmenu]` in config.ini. If set to `False`, saved connections are still
  accessible under a "Saved connections" sub-menu.
- If desired, copy the networkmanager_dmenu.desktop to /usr/share/applications
  or ~/.local/share/applications.
- If you want to run the script as $USER instead of ROOT
    1. Set [PolicyKit permissions][5]. The script is usable for connecting to
       pre-existing connections without setting these, but you won't be able to
       enable/disable networking or add new connections.
    2. For bluetooth control, the user needs to have access to `/dev/rfkill`. On
       some distros (e.g. Archlinux), `/dev/rfkill` belongs to a group such as
       `rfkill`. In this case, ensure $USER belongs to that group. For other
       distros (e.g. Fedora), you can use udev to ensure `/dev/rfkill` belongs
       to a group. For example, create `/etc/udev/rules.d/10-rfkill.rules`:
       
                KERNEL=="rfkill", GROUP="wheel", MODE="0664"
    
       and then ensure $USER belongs to the `wheel` group.

## Usage

`networkmanager_dmenu [-h] <menu args>`

- Run script or bind to keystroke combination
- If desired, menu options can be passed on the command line instead of or in
  addition to the config file. These will override options in the config file.
